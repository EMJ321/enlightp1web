    <p1> Hey! My name is Darye. </p1>
   <br/>
   <br/>
    <p1> I first learned how to code in python two summers ago for about two months. That was a lot of fun, but because I switched my major to design, I was so busy with taking design courses that I didn't have a chance until now to get back into coding. </p1>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <p1> I'm currently interested in UI/UX design which is why I'm taking this bootcamp since I wanted to learn HTML and CSS. So far, it's been pretty fun to see the connection between the design concept and the execution, and I'm excited to see what I'll learn next. </p1>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <p1> Outside of school, I do ballroom dancing in my free time with Viennese Waltz and Jive being my favorites. Whenever I go home, I like to hug my cat when he's too sleepy to bite me away. I also love desserts, especially lemon cakes or key lime pies, and adore trying new cafes. </p1>
