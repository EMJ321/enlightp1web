		<h2>Ditto #132</h2>
    <h4> Type: Normal </h4>
   

    <p1> It can reconstitute its entire cellular structure to change into what it sees, but it returns to normal when it relaxes. </p1>
   <br/>
   <br/>
    <p1> By using the move Transform, it can change into any pokemon's appearance. However, Ditto does not evolve into or from any other Pokemon. </p1>
